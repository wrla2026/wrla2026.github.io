<h3 id="paper-submission">Paper submissions</h3>
<p>The program of the workshop will include regular papers, tool papers, education papers, and
work-in-progress presentations. </p>


<ol> <li> <b>Regular papers</b> must contain original contributions,
be clearly written, include appropriate references, and comparison
with related work.  </li>

<li> <b>Tool papers</b> have to present a new tool, a new tool
component, or novel extensions to an existing tool. They should
provide a short description of the theoretical foundations with
relevant citations, emphasize the design and implementation, and give
a clear account of the tool's functionality. The described tools may
be made available online.  </li>

<li> <b>Education papers</b> could contain how to design a course in
which formal methods are taught with the help of, e.g., Maude, Elan,
and CafeOBJ, and what examples are used in such courses.  The workshop
is also a great space to share ideas and tips on teaching Maude, Elan,
and CafeOBJ, and other rewriting logic related tools. </li>

<li> <b>Work-in-progress papers</b> present early-stage work or other
types of innovative or thought-provoking work related to the topics of
the workshop. The difference between work-in-progress and regular
papers is that work-in-progress submissions represent work that has
not reached yet a level of completion for a full refereed selection
process.  </li> </ol>

<p>
All submissions should be formatted according to the guidelines for
Springer LNCS papers, and should not exceed 16 pages (for regular papers), 10 pages (for tool and education papers), 
and 8 pages (for work-in-progress presentations) excluding bibliography.

<h3 id="paper-submission">Publication</h3>

<p>All accepted papers will be presented at the workshop and included
   in the pre-proceedings, which will be available during the
   workshop.  Following the tradition of the last editions, regular,
   tool, and invited papers will be published as a volume in
   Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series to be
   distributed after the workshop.</p>
