Rewriting is a natural model of computation and an expressive semantic
framework for concurrency, parallelism, communication, and
interaction. It can be used for specifying a wide range of systems and
languages in various application domains. It also has good properties
as a metalogical framework for representing logics. Several successful
languages based on rewriting (ASF+SDF, CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude) have been
designed and implemented. The aim of WRLA is to bring together
researchers with a common interest in rewriting and its applications,
and to give them the opportunity to present their recent work, discuss
future research directions, and exchange ideas.
